# Task1: Understanding credit score

## Key Concepts of Credit Risk

- Definition: Credit risk is the potential that a borrower will fail to meet obligations in accordance with agreed terms. It's crucial for lenders to assess creditworthiness, especially for micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) that may lack traditional credit histories.
- Importance of Credit Scoring: Effective credit scoring models help predict the likelihood of default, influencing lending decisions and risk management.
- Alternative Credit Scoring: This modern approach uses alternative data sources (like transaction records) to evaluate creditworthiness, improving access to finance for MSMEs.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to extract insights and visualize the data using Python. The EDA process is modularized into functions for better maintainability and reusability. The project also includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the functions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and pip installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
To perform EDA on your dataset, update the data_url in the main function of your_script.py with the path to your CSV file. Then run the script:
- Run it as you see in the analysis.ipynb
